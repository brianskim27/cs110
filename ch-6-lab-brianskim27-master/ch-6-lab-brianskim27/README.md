## SUMMARY:
 In Part A, I created functions that draws out a dartboard using a turtle, and then created a function that simulates throwing a dart at the dartboard by using the turtle and creating a dot where the dart supposedly landed (x,y). In Part B, I created a two-player darts game where the players take turns throwing a dart, and if it lands in the circle, it is marked in blue and they score a point. The player with the most points after 10 rounds wins. In Part C, I used the Monte Carlo Simulation where I set up a function that throws x number of darts towards the dartboard, counts the number of darts in the circle, and then approximates pi by dividing the number of darts in the circle by the total number of darts thrown and then multiplying the product by 4.

## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS:
 This was a lot of fun to make, although the dartboard would look nicer with a smoother circle!
