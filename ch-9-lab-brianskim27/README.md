## SUMMARY:
I created my own library for strings, using a Class as a module with different functions inside that can be imported to perform different tasks related to strings. This includes counting the number of vowels in a string, returning the first 2 and last 2 characters in a string, returning a string where repeated characters of the first character are changed to "*", finding the sum of all ASCII values in a string, and incrementing all letters in a string by the length of the string.
