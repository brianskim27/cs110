## SUMMARY:
In Part A, I first created a variable count and set it equal to 0. Then, in main(), I wrote code that runs seq3np1() n times based on user-input (start). The count variable would then return the number of iterations it took for the current iteration of n in the range 1 to n to finally equal 1.
In Part B, I created a graphing function that takes the user-inputted number n and graphs the current iteration in the range of n (x-axis) and the highest-collected value of the count variable (# of iterations for n to equal 1) (y-axis), as well as writes out the current iteration and the highest count so far. Whenever the result of an iteration is greater than the current highest count, it replaces that number to be the newest highest count.

## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS:
In the beginning of Part B, the lab description says that "the x axis is the upper bound and the y axis is the number of iterations." However, later on it emphasizes that "the x axis should be the current value of the loop iterator + 10 and the y axis should be the max_so_far value + 10." To avoid confusion and follow a logical setup, I went with the latter.
