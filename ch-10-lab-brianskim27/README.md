## SUMMARY:
I created a file called Rectangle.py that takes the x, y coordinates and width and height and returns them as dimensions of the rectangle. If any of the inputted values are less than 0, they will be defaulted to 0 before the rectangle dimensions are returned. I then created a file called Surface.py that creates a rectangle object from a set of x, y coorinates and width and height, as well as takes the filename string of the image file. It then returns the rectangle object.
