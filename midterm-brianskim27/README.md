## SUMMARY:
What did you clean up?: I cleaned up the program by creating functions for the code so that it is easier to follow/understand and allow more reusability. For example, instead of using hardcore or set values, I included variables so that other values can be used. I also made sure to name and rename variables so that the reader has an easier time going through the code and understanding it with clarity.

Summary of function(s) added: I added a function that works more efficiently in terms of singleCall and multipleCalls called race that has the turtles take turns going forward a random distance between a minimum and maximum value while accumulating their distances traveled. At the end of the iteration, the function then moves the turtles back to their starting positions and returns the values of the total distances traveled by the turtles. This allows the program to identify which turtle traveled farther and ultimately won the race in the main function.

Summary of Feature Added: The program asks the user what shape to draw and draws a polygon based on the number of sides the user inputted.

## KNOWN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE PARTS:
 N/A

## REFERENCES:
N/A

## MISCELLANEOUS COMMENTS:
No matter what I did (I followed all the steps from the slides and tried many internet solutions) I could not print/return the string form of self.turtle_1/self.turtle_2. I tested it out by giving the function a parameter, but it still would not print the turtle in its string form.
