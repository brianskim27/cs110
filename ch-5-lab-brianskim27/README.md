## SUMMARY:
 My program consists of a variety of functions. One sets up a window with a size of coordinates (-2pi,-1) to (2pi,1), while another sets up an x-axis and y-axis. It uses three functions of sine, cosine, and tangent to draw their graphical points on the window from -360 degrees to 360 degrees. The program uses a turtle to draw everything, including the axes and the graphs. All of the functions are run under one main function.
